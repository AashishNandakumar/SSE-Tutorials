Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets are both real-time communication protocols that use HTTP connections. The main difference between them is that SSE is one-way, while WebSockets is two-way. Here are some other differences:
    Message structure
    SSE is pure text, while WebSockets can handle both text and binary messages.

Complexity
WebSockets are more complex and require more developer input than SSE.

Performance
WebSockets generally perform better than SSE in terms of latency and throughput.

Server resources
SSE can be more efficient than WebSockets when it comes to server resources.

Use cases
WebSockets are better for interactive applications that require real-time communication in both directions, like chat apps and multiplayer collaboration. SSE is better for efficiently pushing updates from the server to clients, like in a stock ticker application.

Protocol
WebSocket uses the WebSocket protocol, while SSE uses standard HTTP/HTTPS.

Data format limitations
SSE is limited to transporting only UTF-8 data, so it doesn't support binary data.

Number of open connections
When not used over HTTP/2, SSE can have limitations with regard to the maximum number of open connections.
